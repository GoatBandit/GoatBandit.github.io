                                        Playing video games most of my life, I would always wonder about the processes they go through to become the thing we see and play. I have
                                        also always had a deep drive to help educate people, probably stemming from my drive to self-teach from a young age.
                                        <br><br>
                                        So, in the summer of 2019 I decided I was going to learn about development, going so far as to change from my BSc Real Estate course to
                                        BSc Games Technology. It was scary at the time but honestly I wasn't very happy before switching courses so it was for the best. Now I'm
                                        able to do passion projects that mean a great deal to me and actually call it work, with it all going into my portfolio, how great is that?!
                                        <br><br>
                                        To avoid delving into too much pointless detail, I'll just say that for years I couldn't find the right career fit. I have never been too
                                        interested in academic work, while always loving practical work. I've explored so many different career paths but I was either medically
                                        unable to do them or they just weren't as interesting as I'd hoped. Being a programmer, while highly frustrating at times, I believe is the 
                                        perfect career path and I haven't looked back since.
