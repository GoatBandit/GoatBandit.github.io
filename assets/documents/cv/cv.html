							<h2> Planning App </h2>
							<p class="subSectionDetails">
								C# | Software Development
							</p>
							<p>
								Intended to be a one-size-fits-all kind of situation, I wanted to make a planning app that's as close to perfect as I can manage. I've always been a very
								detailed orientated person and have found that the apps that I've tried to use to plan out certain things never quite have everything I need. So, instead
								of waiting for the app I would love to see get developed by someone else, I decided to make it. <br><br>

								The intention is to have enough features and flexibility that the user can create whatever list they desire without the app seeming too overwhelming to
								the average person. Examples of this could include: a to-do style shopping list that includes item prices, a timetable that shows you your set daily tasks,
								or even a flow chart style to-do list so that you can plan each step chronologically. <br><br>

								Initially I was planning to make this in Android Studio but complications led me to using Unity instead for my first software development project. <br><br>

								This project is still currently under development.

							<h2> Fantasy Map Generator </h2>
							<p class="subSectionDetails">
								C# | Procedural Generation
							</p>
							<p>
								A university coursework assignment had me looking into procedural "blocky" generation. So, after testing out different projects of: Endless Voxel Terrain,
								Marching Cubes Terrain, and Plane-Based Flat-Shaded Vertex Terrain. I landed on this project in the end due to it covering assignment specifications while
								allowing a lot of room to develop an independent program fit for fantasy-based hobbies. All code for this project can be found at this 
								<a href="https://github.com/GoatBandit/FantasyMapGenerator">GitHub repository</a>. <br><br>

								This project is still currently under development and I'm not sure if it will ever be completely done due to the sheer amount parameters can be added to the 
								map generation settings. Though, I do believe a built version of the project will be available for release soon.

							<h2> My Portfolio Website </h2>
							<p class="subSectionDetails">
								HTML5, CSS3, JS | Front-End Development
							</p>
							<p>
								With my very first delve into front-end development, I decided to try and create a professional-looking website with multiple different
								effects, themes, and formats. All code for this website can be found at this 
								<a href="https://github.com/GoatBandit/GoatBandit.github.io">GitHub repository</a>. <br><br>

								After furthering my understanding of the used languages through developing the website, I would say that if I was to do this project again I
								would definitely go in with a design plan rather than trying to come up with all design decisions on the spot. This was a lot of fun though
								and I know for sure that I will be looking to do more front-end development and update this website's code to make it cleaner and more efficient. <br><br>

								Of course, alongside the development of the portfolio website I had to create a CV and resume to match. Each of these are their own separate webpages
								completely independent of the main files. So this website offered me three great chances for practicing not just my development skills but alongside
								my designing skills as each of the 3 items would have to have a very different feel due to their different purposes. <br><br>

								This project is still currently under development.

						<h3> Small Projects: </h3>

						<article>
							<h4> First Gameplay Map </a></h4>
							<p class="subSectionDetails">
								C++ | Unreal Engine
							</p>
							<p>
								A university assignment had us modelling a full-sized island that fits the given brief. The brief mentioned how the island must feel like one of the
								Scottish isles. With this in mind, I decided to aim for a more horror-esc design, making the map have a general wet, creepy, and mysterious feel in
								order to work with the Lovecraftian "other worldly" goal. This served as an introduction to Unreal Engine 4.
