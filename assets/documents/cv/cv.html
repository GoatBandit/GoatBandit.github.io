							<h4> My Portfolio Website </h4>
							<p class="subSectionDetails">
								HTML5, CSS3, JS
							</p>
							<p>
								With my very first delve into front-end development, I decided to try and create a professional-looking website with multiple different
								effects, themes, and formats. All code for this website can be found at the 
								<a href="https://github.com/GoatBandit/GoatBandit.github.io">corresponding GitHub repository</a>. <br><br>
								After furthering my understanding of the used languages through developing the website, I would say that if I was to do this project again I
								would definitely go in with a design plan rather than trying to come up with all design decisions on the spot. This was a lot of fun though
								and I know for sure that I will be looking to do more front-end development and update this website's code to make it cleaner and more efficient. <br><br>
								Of course, alongside the development of the portfolio website I had to create a CV and resume to match. Each of these are their own separate webpages
								completely independent of the main files. So this website offered me three great chances for practicing not just my development skills but alongside
								my designing skills as each of the 3 items would have to have a very different feel due to their different purposes.
